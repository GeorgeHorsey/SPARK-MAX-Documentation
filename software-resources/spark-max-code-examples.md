# SPARK MAX Code Examples

At the links below you will find code examples in LabVIEW, Java, and C++ for common SPARK MAX control modes. We will be adding examples as we develop them, so please check back regularly. Examples included as of 2/6/19:

* [LabVIEW Code Examples](https://github.com/REVrobotics/SPARK-MAX-Examples/tree/master/LabVIEW)
  * Arcade Drive with CAN
  * Arcade Drive with PWM
  * Get and Set Parameters
  * Limit Switch
  * Position Closed-loop Control
  * Reading Encoder Values
  * Smart Motion Example
  * Velocity Closed-loop Control
* [Java Code Examples](https://github.com/REVrobotics/SPARK-MAX-Examples/tree/master/Java)
  * Get and Set Parameters
  * Limit Switch
  * Motor Follower
  * Position Closed-loop Control
  * Reading Encoder Values
  * Smart Motion Example
  * Tank Drive with CAN
  * Velocity Closed-loop Control
* [C++ Code Examples](https://github.com/REVrobotics/SPARK-MAX-Examples/tree/master/C%2B%2B)
  * Arcade Drive with CAN
  * Arcade Drive with PWM
  * Get and Set Parameters
  * Limit Switch
  * Position Closed-loop Control
  * Reading Encoder Values
  * Smart Motion Example
  * Velocity Closed-loop Control

Even though some examples may only exist in a particular language, they can be a good place to start as the APIs are very similar between languages.
